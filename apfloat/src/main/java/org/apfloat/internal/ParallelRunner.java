 * Class for running <code>ParallelRunnable</code> objects in parallel using

 * <code>ExecutorService</code> that is limited to a number of threads that is
 * one less than the number of processors. This way, when also the current thread
 * runs batches from the <code>ParallelRunnable</code>, CPU utilization should be
 * maximized but only so that no more threads are actively executing than the
 * number of processors.
