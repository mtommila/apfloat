/**
 * Elementary modulo arithmetic functions for <code>long</code> data.<p>
 *
 * Modular addition and subtraction are trivial, when the modulus is less
 * than 2<sup>63</sup> and overflow can be detected easily.<p>
 *
 * Modular multiplication is more complicated, and since it is usually
 * the single most time consuming operation in the whole program execution,
 * the very core of the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), it should be
 * carefully optimized.<p>
 *
 * The algorithm for multiplying two <code>long</code>s and taking the
 * remainder is not entirely obvious. The basic problem is to get the
 * full 128-bit result of multiplying two 64-bit integers. Before the
 * introduction of {@link Math#multiplyHigh(long, long)} it was impractically
 * slow. The legacy of this code is that the older algorithm used an
 * approach where the top 52 bits of the multiplication would be retrieved
 * by converting the operands to <code>double</code> and <code>long</code>s
 * would only be used to get the lowest 64 bits of the result. With round-off
 * errors this allows using only 57 bits in the multiplication operands. For
 * serialization compatibility, this algorithm still has the same limitation.
 * <p>
 *
 * The first observation is that since the modulus is practically
 * constant, it should be more efficient to calculate (once) the inverse
 * of the modulus, and then subsequently multiply by the inverse modulus
 * instead of dividing by the modulus.<p>
 *
 * The second observation is that to get the remainder of the division,
 * we don't necessarily need the actual result of the division (we just
 * want the remainder). So, we should discard the top half bits of the
 * full 128-bit result whenever possible, to save a few operations.<p>
 *
 * The basic approach is to get an approximation of <code>a * b / modulus</code>.
 * To calculate the approximate division, we multiply by the inverse modulus
 * using fixed-point multiplication (where the inverse modulus is calculated to
 * 63 bits of precision) and {@link Math#multiplyHigh(long, long)}. With 57-bit
 * multiplicands and 63 bits of the inverse modulus, and a prime modulus, the
 * approximation should be within 1 of the correct result. Thus we simply calculate
 * <code>a * b - approximateDivision * modulus</code> to get the initial remainder.
 * It is then easy to detect the case when the approximate division was off by one
 * as the final step of the algorithm.
