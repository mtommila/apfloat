Apfloat is an arbitrary precision arithmetic library. Most operations e.g.
multiplication can be done with O(n&nbsp;log&nbsp;n) complexity. That is, when
the number of digits doubles, the execution time only slightly more than
doubles.<p>

Apfloat requires Java 8 or later.<p>

The apfloat library has been designed for high performance, but as it is 100%
Java, the achievement is somewhat limited compared to various other existing
libraries written in C and assembler. For best performance it's recommended to
use the fastest Java Virtual Machine available, for example OpenJDK's server VM.<p>
